# Project Presentation:

## Overview:
As part of the project aimed at developing an application to prevent psychological or socio-economic impacts, assist the needy, homeless individuals, unemployed individuals, and those experiencing domestic violence, we have opted to create a comprehensive software solution for managing a charitable humanitarian association.

Our software is designed to enhance the management capabilities of the association, maximizing the utilization of their resources. Through this application, members of the association can efficiently operate, especially during the current pandemic situation.

## Motivation:
The COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly pushed numerous individuals into precarious situations, causing unprecedented challenges. This has necessitated a rapid response from associations, as traditional support systems have been disrupted. We are witnessing a surge in first-time aid seekers: families affected by partial unemployment, individuals in tourism or events industries suddenly left without income, temporary workers struggling to find assignmentsâ€”all forced to turn to food aid for support.

Our software addresses these challenges by enabling associations to assist more individuals in less time through effective resource organization. Additionally, it supports the maintenance of mental health during confinement by leveraging volunteer psychologists' assistance. Furthermore, it aids in identifying regions most affected by the virus, guiding the allocation of aid resources based on statistical insights.

## Implementation Details:
We developed the software using Java for both the application logic and graphical user interface (GUI) development. PL/SQL was utilized for database management. All system diagrams, including utilisation guide, can be found in the "Rapport Projet GL2.docx" file within the repository.
